5.   Model Building & Deployment


1. what is  Understanding the Problem
• Define the objectives clearly.
• Determine how to measure the project  success.
• Identify the problem type (e.g., classification, regression,)

2. what is Gathering Relevant Data
• Collect data from other  sources.
• Ensure data is relevant to the problem.
• Consider the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of the data.

3 what is   Data Preparation & EDA 
• EDA  is stand for Exploratory Data Analysis
• Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates) from the data.
• Perform exploratory analysis to understand the data.
• So that the data should be prepared for error 

4.  Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction
• We need to select exactly that feature which we want to select
• Create new features that can help improve model performance.
• Reduce dimensionality if the feature space is too large.
• Select the most important features to be used for modeling.

5.  Model Building & Deployment
• Choose appropriate algorithms and train models.
• Validate model performance using cross-validation.
• Deploy the model for real-time use or batch processing.
